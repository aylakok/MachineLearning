    "Predict whether dresses reviews are positive (>3 stars) or neutral/negative (<4 stars). Write a Jupyter Notebook report documenting your investigation.\n",

    "Dataset\n",

    "- The data set on Kaggle, for context (Links to an external site.)\n",
    "Included in your Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "- Explain briefly in your own words how the bag-of-words model and Naïve Bayes work, and how they work together.\n",
    "- Pre-processing steps (don’t forget to filter out all non-dress reviews).\n",
    "- The head() of the resulting dataframe.\n",
    "- Text pre-processing steps resulting in a document-feature matrix\n",
    "- Split the file into a training and a test set.\n",
    "- Train a Naïve Bayes classifier predicting whether a review is positive (>3 stars) or neutral/negative (<4 stars).\n",
    "- Evaluate the performance of your model on the test set.\n",
    "- Check out 3 cases where your model is off target. Inspect the associated texts. Do you understand why your model trips up? Explain.\n",

    "Please provide a link to your Notebook on GitHub . Make sure the GitHub folder includes the data file so the Notebook runs without problems.\n",

    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only comments on the code should be in coding formatting. Answers to questions in the assignment (e.g., \"Explain how linear regression works in your own words\" or \"evaluate the performance of your model\") are in text (Markdown) cells.\n",
    "- Use Markdown formula notation for mathematical formulas http://csrgxtu.github.io/2015/03/20/Writing-Mathematic-Fomulars-in-Markdown/\n",
    "- The Jupyter Notebook should run in its entirety. An assignment that doesn't run will not be scored \"complete\". If you can't get a certain section to run, please comment out the code and explain what you would want it to do."
